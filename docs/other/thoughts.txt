General goals for this project:
    1. Completely cross platform - should be able to easily build and run on Windows and Linux.
    2. Completely open source, using open source tools and libraries.
    3. 2d sprites with shaders. Maybe 3d.

Specific goals for the implementation:
    1. Complete separation between game/ and engine/. engine/ should not depend on game/ at all.
       In this way we can actually have multiple game/ folders (e.g., game/ and demo/)
    2. engine/ should hide all implementation details from game/ (e.g., no GLFW stuff). If I want to
       completely gut engine/ I should be able with no changes to game/ as long as I keep the
       interfaces the same.
